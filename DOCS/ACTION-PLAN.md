                    "Format holds. Renderer works. File runs anywhere."

  PARALLEL WORK POSSIBLE:
  - 0.1 and initial 0.2 function signatures can overlap
  - 0.3 can start once createGrid + getCell exist
  - 0.5 grows incrementally as 0.2 adds functions

  ESTIMATED TIME: 2 weeks focused, 3 weeks comfortable

----

## Decisions Made
- Sparse cell storage (only non-default cells) — keeps files small
- additionalProperties: true at ALL levels — forward compatible
- density is optional with advisory auto-calc — consumers own the mapping
- channel object is per-cell, optional — most cells don't need it
- UUID v4 for meta.id — globally unique without server
- Semantic enum is extensible — unknown values fall back to "solid"

## Open Questions for Phase 1+
- Should .grid support binary packing for large grids (1000x1000)?
  → Defer. JSON is fine for Phase 0-2. Revisit at Phase 4 (3D) *TODO*.
- Should frames support diff-from-previous (delta encoding)?
  → Defer. Full sparse cells for now. Optimize when profiling shows need.
- Should we add a `generator` field to cells (tracking which algorithm made them)?
  → Nice to have. Add in v0.2.0 if procedural generators need provenance.
- **Export Optimization**: Current export includes all computed properties (density, semantic) → 4x size increase (`schemas\examples\creative-showcase.grid` 344→1360 lines). Add "compact export" option for sparse format in Phase 1.

## Phase 0 Complete 

All Phase 0 deliverables are now complete and verified:

1. **Task 0.1** - .grid Schema Definition (spec + schema + 3 examples)
2. **Task 0.2** - grid-core.js (33 functions, pure logic, zero DOM)  
3. **Task 0.3** - canvas-renderer.js (Canvas2D renderer with playback)
4. **Task 0.4** - Single HTML proof-of-life (dist/index.html, < 200KB)

## Phase 1 Closure Note

After Task 1.5, Phase 1 is declared DONE. Disposition of all Phase 1 tasks:

| Task | Status | Note |
|------|--------|------|
| 1.1 WebGL2 renderer    | COMPLETE  | 17/17 browser tests. 3.2x speedup over Canvas2D. |
| 1.2 WebGPU path        | DEFERRED  | Moved to Phase 4+. WebGL2 sufficient for Phase 1-3. |
| 1.3 textmode.js bridge | DEFERRED  | No textmode.js projects currently in scope. Revisit at Phase 3. |
| 1.4 Input system       | COMPLETE  | 44/44 tests. Canvas interactive. Keyboard unified. |
| 1.5 Generators v2      | COMPLETE  | 276/276 tests. All 5 channels. 10 generators. colorMode select. |
| 1.6 Image importer     | COMPLETE  | 36/36 tests. Modal UI. All 5 channels from pixels. |

Phase 1 exit gate (after 1.5):
"Every generator populates all 5 cell channels. The .grid carries semantic meaning.
Consumers (music, 3D, AI) can read from channel without guessing.
Phase 2 (OPFS persistence) can begin."

---

## ✅ TASK 1.5 COMPLETE — PHASE 1 CLOSED (2026-02-27)

### What shipped
- `src/generators/generators.js` — 10 generators, all 5 channels, zero DOM
- `tests/test-generators.js` — 276 tests, 0 failures
- `dist/index.html` — colorMode select, 3 new generator buttons (Pulse, Matrix, Terrain)
- All 10 generators produce cells with channel.audio + channel.spatial populated

### Verification
```
node tests/run-all.js
→ 378 passed, 0 failed (all suites)
```

### New generators
| Generator | Algorithm | Unique feature |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Pulse     | Concentric rings from center | opts.rings parameter |
| Matrix    | Vertical fade columns | Bright head, fading tail |
| Terrain   | Layered sine octaves | Biome semantics (void/fluid/solid/emissive) |

### Channel schema delivered
Every cell from every generator carries:
```json
"channel": {
  "audio":   { "note": 0-127, "velocity": 0-127, "duration": 1 },
  "spatial": { "height": 0-1, "material": "solid|fluid|void|emissive..." }
}
```
- note: Y position → MIDI pitch (top=127, bottom=0)
- velocity: density → amplitude
- height: density → 3D extrusion height
- material: semantic string → 3D surface type

### Color modes
- `fixed` — user-selected color (backward compatible)
- `mono` — same hue, brightness varies with density
- `derived` — hue from generator geometry (angle, distance, terrain height)

**Phase 1 is DONE. Next: Phase 2 (OPFS persistence).**

# PHASE 3 ACTION PLAN: THE MUSIC CONSUMER

**"The grid plays"**

---

## What Already Exists (Foundation from Phases 0–2)

Before designing anything, here's what we're building on:

| Asset | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| `channel.audio` schema | Every cell already carries `{ note: 0-127, velocity: 0-127, duration: 1 }` |
| Project settings | BPM, key, scale already in project metadata (Phase 2.3) |
| 10 generators | All populate `channel.audio` — note from Y position, velocity from density |
| grid-core.js | `getCellsBySemantic()`, `getCellsByChannel()` — query cells by channel data |
| Input system | `cellDown/Move/Up/Hover/action` events — ready for music-mode interactions |
| OPFS persistence | Auto-save means musical grids survive sessions |

**Key insight**: The data is already there. Phase 3 is about *reading* `channel.audio` and turning it into sound. No schema changes needed.

# PHASE 3: THE MUSIC CONSUMER

## Task 3.1 — Grid-to-Music Mapping Engine
### Delivered
- `src/consumers/music/music-mapper.js` — pure functions mapping cells to note events (including fixes for note clamping and defaults)
- `tests/test-music-mapper.js` — 15 test cases passing cleanly

### Verification
- Tested all 10 scales.
- Chromatic/quantized row mapping functions seamlessly.
- Note events appropriately map colors to channels, duration/velocity inference works properly.
- All edge-cases, clamping boundaries, and unprovided configurations fallback successfully without corruption.
- Fully integrated into `tests/run-all.js` making 15 added music mapper tests pass in node environment zero DOM.

## Task 3.2 — Web Audio Synthesis Layer
### Delivered
- `src/consumers/music/synth-engine.js` — A Web Audio synthesis layer that takes `NoteEvent[]` and produces sound. Zero external dependencies.
- `tests/test-synth-engine.js` — 41 tests using a MockAudioContext.

### Features
| Feature | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **6 instruments** | Lead (sawtooth), Bass (sine), Pad (triangle), Arp (square), Drums (noise), FX (sine) |
| **ADSR envelopes** | applyADSR() — attack→peak→decay→sustain→release via gain automations |
| **Drum synthesis** | playDrum() — hi-hat (noise+HP, note>80), snare (noise+tone, 51-80), kick (sine sweep, ≤50) |
| **Tonal voices** | playTonalNote() — osc→lowpass filter→gain→destination |
| **Polyphony cap** | limitPolyphony() — 16 max voices per column, drops lowest-velocity |
| **Transport** | play(), stop(), pause(), resume() |
| **Playback cursor** | rAF tick fires `onColumnChange(col)` at step boundaries; loop support |
| **Volume** | setMasterVolume(0-1) with clamping |
| **Instrument override** | setInstrument(channel, def) for runtime customization |

### Verification
```
node tests/test-synth-engine.js  → 41 passed, 0 failed
node tests/run-all.js            → 554 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped
```

## Task 3.6 — UI Integration (dist/index.html)
### Delivered
- `setPlayheadColumn(col)` added to the canvas renderer — draws rgba(0,255,136,0.18) column overlay
- `music-mapper` and `synth-engine` inlined into `dist/index.html` (exports stripped, all comments preserved)        
- `playbackMode`, `audioCtx`, `synth` added to app state
- Mode toggle button (Frames / Music) in toolbar
- `togglePlayback()` / `stopPlayback()` dispatch by mode
- `toggleMusicPlayback()`, `stopMusicPlayback()`, `keyToMidi()`, `togglePlaybackMode()` implemented
- Cleanup on project load/create (stop synth, close audioCtx, reset mode + button)
- `synth(te)` → `extractTouch(te)` rename inside createInputSystem (naming collision fix)

### Verification
- Test suite: 554 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped


## Task 3.4 — Web MIDI Output (src/consumers/music/midi-output.js)
### Delivered
- `src/consumers/music/midi-output.js` — createMIDIOutput() factory
- `tests/test-midi-output.js` — 39 tests, Node-compatible MIDI mock

### Features
| Function | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| `isAvailable()` | Feature-detects `navigator.requestMIDIAccess` — no throws |
| `isReady()` | True only after `init()` succeeds AND port selected |
| `init()` | Requests MIDI access; always resolves `{ok, error?}`, never rejects |
| `getOutputs()` | `→ [{id, name}]` — safe before init (returns []) |
| `selectOutput(id)` | `→ boolean` |
| `sendNoteOn/Off()` | Immediate send, no-op when no port selected |
| `sendAllNotesOff()` | CC 123 on all 16 channels — clean hard stop |
| `scheduleEvents(events, bpm)` | Lookahead scheduler: 50ms window, 25ms tick |
| `stop()` | Cancels interval, clears pending queue |
| `destroy()` | Full teardown |

### Verification
```
node tests/test-midi-output.js  → 39 passed, 0 failed
node tests/run-all.js           → 593 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped
```

## Tasks DEFERRED

### Task 3.3 — Glicol WASM Integration → DEFER to Phase 8

**Reason**: Glicol adds graph-based DSP (filters, reverb, delay). The Web Audio synth in 3.2 already covers the core need. Glicol's value is in professional sound design — that's Phase 8 (Studio) territory.

**When to revisit**: After 3.2 ships, if users want more sophisticated synthesis.

### Task 3.5 — Orca-compatible Grid Mode → DEFER to Phase 7

**Reason**: Orca is a spatial programming paradigm that shares .grid's grid topology but has very different semantics (operators, bangs, ports). Building Orca compat requires an operator interpreter that doesn't exist yet. It's closer to the Narrative Consumer (Phase 7, entity system + state machines).

**When to revisit**: Phase 7, when entity systems and per-cell state machines are built.

## Phase 3 Exit Criteria (from charter, refined)

```
✓ Draw on grid → hear music in real-time
✓ X = time, Y = pitch, density = velocity, color = channel
✓ 10 scales available (chromatic, major, minor, pentatonic, blues, ...)
✓ Transport: play, stop, loop, BPM control
✓ Playhead cursor scrolls across grid during playback
✓ Procedural generators create playable compositions
✓ MIDI output to external DAW verified (Chrome)
✓ Offline: Web Audio only. No server dependency.
✓ All new code has tests. Total suite stays green.
```

---

## Design decisions

1. **Multi-frame playback**: Should Play go through all frames sequentially (like an arrangement), or play the current frame on loop? → **Decision**: Current frame with loop, add frame-chain later.

2. **Polyphony limit**: Multiple cells in the same column = chord. Cap at 16 simultaneous voices? → **Decision**: Yes, 16 voices max, drop lowest-velocity notes.

3. **Drum row**: Reserve the bottom N rows for drums (channel 4), or rely entirely on color? → **Decision**: Color-based. Let users paint drums anywhere. Drum behavior triggers from channel assignment, not row position.

4. **Live painting while playing**: Should painting a cell during playback make sound immediately, or only on next loop? → **Decision**: Immediate — paint a cell, hear it on the next column pass. This is the magic moment.

5. **Audio preview on hover**: In play mode, hovering a cell plays a short pip of its note? → **Decision**: Yes, but gated behind play mode (not paint mode). Short 50ms blip.

## Some fun:

- This standalone .grid file showcases the multi-instrumental synthesis engine with Lead, Bass, Pads, Arps, and Drums all working together in an 'A Minor Pentatonic' scale at 110 BPM. `schemas\examples\grid-symphony.grid`

- `neon-pulse-drive.grid` It features a "Neon Pulse Drive" groove at 110 BPM with a side-chained bass feel!

- `scale-reference.grid`: A simple diagonal pattern showing how rows map to the A Minor Pentatonic scale across two octaves.
- `basic-drum-loop.grid`: A standard 110 BPM percussion pattern with a kick on beats 1 & 3, snare on 2 & 4, and eighth-note hi-hats.
These files are great for testing the music engine's pitch accuracy and channel separation. 

-  Bach's "Prelude in C Major" (Measure 1-4) `schemas\examples\bach-prelude.grid`
It's set to 75 BPM on the Chromatic scale. I used the Yellow "Arp" channel, which has a fast attack and low decay, making it perfect for the iconic flowing arpeggios of this piece.

# Phase 4 — The 3D Consumer

## What I'm building:

- This phase introduces a 3D consumer for the GRID project, allowing users to view their 2D grids as 3D scenes using Three.js. This includes a pure heightmap engine for data transformation, a browser-based scene builder, and integration into the existing web UI.

- `src/consumers/spatial/heightmap.js` — grid → heightmap data (pure, zero DOM)
- `src/consumers/spatial/scene-builder.js` — Three.js scene from heightmap (browser)
- `tests/test-heightmap.js` — Node-compatible tests
- `dist/index.html` — 🧊 3D mode tab added

- 68/68.

## `PHASE4-INTEGRATION-PATCH`

10 labeled surgical patches to apply to `dist/index.html`: CDN script tag, CSS, HTML, module inlining, app state, the 4 functions (`enter3DMode`, `exit3DMode`, `_rebuild3DScene`, `toggle3DMode`), event wiring, and cleanup.

### Resolved a bug 
- (ReferenceError: clamp is not defined) in the rendering loop, allowing the 3D scene to successfully visualize the procedural cell grid.

- Updated _rebuild3DScene in dist/index.html to pull the active frame from the renderer (renderer ? renderer.current : 0). Now, jumping into 3D mode will properly render the frame you're actually viewing in the 2D grid instead of always resetting to frame 0.

-  UX hint has been added to `enter3DMode()` in `dist/index.html`.
> The 3D button's tooltip will now dynamically show which frame is being rendered if the project has multiple frames, and defaults to just "3D View" if there's only one. 


### 

## Deferred:
4.3 VSP bridge → Phase 8. 4.4 glTF export → Phase 6 (export pipeline is the natural home — `getScene()` is already the hook).
